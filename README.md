This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where a route handler attempts to access a user by ID without checking if the ID is valid or if the user exists.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling, preventing unexpected crashes or vulnerabilities.
